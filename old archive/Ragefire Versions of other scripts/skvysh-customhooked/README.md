# Custom server-side scripts for [TES3MP](https://tes3mp.com/) version 0.7.x.

**Note:** scripts by skvysh; ported and customhooked by discordpeter

The scripts found here either add some new features to the gameplay or provide temporary fixes to some issues encountered in the current version of TES3MP. They are easy to install and setup and occasionally provide settings to tune to better suit your needs.
The scripts are in no way official and should not be treated as such.

# Short overview of the scripts

## AntiCurses
The script removes any creatures spawned by the cursed items. Owners are welcome to use setting variables to change which types of cursed items are allowed to spawn their related creatures and which are removed upon picking up the item.

## Boots of Actually Blinding Speed (BOABS)
A harmless script that ensures the boots actually blind player, no matter what magicka resist they have (although it is still possible to bypass this if you have access to console).

## CliffRacerSounds
A not-so-harmless script that plays a random cliff racer sound at random intervals while a player is in the wilderness.

## Criminals
A script that enhances the bounty system in TES3MP by adding messages to the chat when players are wanted, prefixes to criminals' messages and award bounty to those that kill the criminals.

## PlayTime
Script that tracks the play time of players playing on the server and saves it (in seconds) to players' data files. Adds two chat commands to either display individual play time or list the play times of all logged in players.

## RPRolls
Easy-to-setup script that adds a chat command to roll a random number between <skill/attirbute> and 100. The result is displayed locally.

## RecursiveCliffRacers
A TES3MP-implementation of the Recursive Cliff Racers mod, which spawns more cliff racers when one dies.
  
## StartupScripts
Initially named as "RavenRock", script provides a means to load several variables affecting the states of objects, such as Raven Rock colony in Solstheim, Great House strongholds and disabling various entities that should be disabled at the start of the game. The script may be expanded in the future to include even more fixes for various quests (especially the ones in Tribunal and Bloodmoon expansion) by reading journal entries and changing appropariate TES3 variables through console.

## WerewolfRobe
A small script that allows players to equip werewolf robe - the body of a werewolf - without having to transform into one. Some customization is included in the script to limit who can use it and if there is a cost.
