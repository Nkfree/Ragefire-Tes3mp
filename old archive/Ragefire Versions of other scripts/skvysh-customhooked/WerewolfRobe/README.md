## Werewolf Robe
### VERSION 1.0

![Werewolf Robe](https://i.imgur.com/7Ylemds.png)

This small script adds a chat command `/wwrobe` that allows players on the server to equip the elusive "Werewolf Robe". This item is essentially the body of a werewolf and is actually given to player when it turns into a werewolf, however, the item cannot be seen in inventory. Still, the item is saved in the player's datafile, so it can be kept track of. The scripts allows some customization, such as:

• Who is allowed to equip the robe (everyone/mods and admins/admins only)
• Whether the process cost anything (both the item and the amount of item)

## Installing instructions

1) Add this file to server/scripts/custom
2) open customScripts.lua and add this line: require("custom/WWRobe")

10) (OPTIONAL) Open `WWRobe.lua` and edit the variables at the top of the file.

## CHANGELOG:
### 1.0:
Instructions updated for 0.7.x.
